This robot was created more than 10 years ago, when I was an newbie in the world of Robotics and my parents finally gift me my dreamed NXT Kit robot. Unfortunally I didn't created a building guide, but viewing the photos is easy to recreate the robots without problems.

You have the original code at the file "cangrejo.c"

A little video of the robot:
